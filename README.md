## Fun Stuff!

### Twilight Struggle! 
As a fan of strategy games, Twilight Struggle stands out as one of my favorites. Set during the Cold War, it's a brilliantly designed two-player game that blends historical events with intense decision-making, bluffing, and long-term strategy. Whether I'm playing as the US or USSR, each game offers a unique challenge in balancing global influence, military tension, and the ever-present threat of nuclear escalation. It's more than just a game — it's a mental chess match wrapped in history.

I am currently ranked #121 internationally!

### Wingspan! 
Wingspan is a beautifully crafted engine-building game that combines strategic depth with a relaxing, nature-inspired theme. As a bird enthusiast (at least during game night), I enjoy the challenge of building synergistic habitats while learning fun facts about real bird species. It’s a perfect blend of thoughtful planning, peaceful gameplay, and surprisingly competitive edge — a great reminder that even in games, ecosystems thrive on balance and diversity.
